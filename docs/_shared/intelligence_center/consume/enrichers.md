## Enrichers listing

The Enrichers home page lists the status and results of observable enrichment tasks performed from the Observables page or from a Content Proposal. Filters allow you to sort by observable type, enricher or task status.

An enrichment task can be: 

- pending
- in progress
- completed
- failed

You can filter your enrichment tasks either by Observable type, Enricher type or task status.
