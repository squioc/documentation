# Cases

Cases enable you to regroup your investigation findings across multiple perimeters, alerts and analysts and share your results with your end-users in an efficient manner. 

You can either create a new case from an existing alert or add alerts to an existing case. 
## Cases listing
The listing page lists all the cases across your community. 
They can be listed following multiple filters: 

- Status (open or closed cases)
- Assigned to or Created by
- Tags associated
 
You can also sort your cases depending on:

- Last edition (default)
- Creation date
- Priority (low, medium, high)
